    SUPER ANNOYING THAT THE COURSE DOES NOT INCLUDE EMPTY EXTRA CREDIT FILES.
    TODO: EVERYTIME INSTALL A NEW MODULE FOR THE COURSE,
    REMEMBER TO DO THE FOLLOWING BEFORE START THE COURSE:
        1) Create Empty File for Every Extra Credit "challenge" in Every Exercise.
           (Easiest way I found is to copy every FINAL Extra Credit Solution file
             into a temp folder. This will give me every file name I need.
             Now Open every one of these files, Delete all Code, Save & Close.
             Now move all those files into my "exercise" folder,
             and delete the temp folder
            )
            Reason this is needed is because the platform needs those files to
              EXIST before the server is started, in order for the platform to be
              able to incorporate those files into the platform itself.
              The files will not show up in the exercise file tabs for the exercise set,
              the output for any file changes will not show up, the tests will not
              run, and even the link to open the file in an isolated window will not work!!
            Not only is the CONFUSING, until the issue is figured out..
            It is terrible UX, ANNOYING, a stupid thing to have to remember to do
            (the type thing computers were designed to handle!
            and TIME CONSUMING, mindless CHORE.

            KC Dodds could EASILY & Quickly create all those empty files,
              so they would be immediately available to every course student,
              WITHOUT HASSLE, the MOMENT they start their course.
              And would eliminate confusion and frustration when students cannot
              figure out why sometimes extra credit shows up, and other times does not,
              and how do they get the extra credit to work.
              To the user, the platform/course seems BUGGY (and it is..)
              until they figure out the WORK AROUND or fix.
              It took me until Lesson 1.5 to get this right.)

            It takes 4 MINUTES to restart the server!

        2)  Remember to change TEST files from "final" folder to "exercise" folder
            for ALL tests.

        3)  Add MY ENV file so the platform uses CHROME Browser,
                instead of MY Default Browser (Edge or Edge Beta, ATM)

        4)  FORK his repo First!
            Use MY forked URL
            Add his as Upstream
            Create a Branch for all MY Exercise Commits.


    create empty extra-credit files

    create empty extra-credit files for all remaining exercises.
    Now once restart server, the platform can show and run any code I add
    to those files.
    (ie FIXES the platform, now can DO the extra credit
        without restarting the server EVERY time!
    The empty files should all have came with the course !!!,
        as the platform depends on those files already
        existing for each exercise set, when the exercise is started.
        and requires us to create the file and restart the server otherwise.
    )

    Annoyingly, the course does not create files for the "extra credit".
    And the way the course is designed, that means they do not show up in the
    "course" (platform).
    So, the server must be stopped and the file manually created every time.
    Then the SERVER MUST BE RESTARTED, each time an exercise/extra-credit
    file is created, in order for
    the course platform to be able to load it to show the file in the tab
    row, and to show the output of the exercise, and even to open the file
    up in an "isolated tab".  Unless the file already exists, the PLATFORM
    cannot embed the file into its interactive materials.
    And restarting the server takes Several MINUTES.

    I get that he wanted the extra credit files to start out empty. That is fine.
    But include the EMPTY FILES! As is, his UX is RE: extra credit, is ANNOYING!.
    So, I created the remaining files so the platform has these empty files
    available and able to be read into the platform.

    NOTE TO SELF: FOR EACH MODULE DOWNLOADED:
    - change all tests to run on MY code, instead of his solution code!
    - create an extra credit file for EVERY extra credit exercise in the module.
        (I copied every extra credit solution file into a temp directory.
        Then opened and deleted the code from every file in that temp directory.
        saved and closed the file.
        Then moved all those files into my "exercise" directory, and deleted temp dir.
        This was the easiest way to capture every extra credit file name
        that will need to exist eventually.
        )

    Note: cra recommends this solution for reading which OS and Browser users have installed,
        and selecting the preferred browser form this ordered list.

    // How save this file to my repo for PERSONAL CONSUMPTION ONLY??
    // saved with the repo and code, but hidden from others? UGH.
    // if gitignore, I may loose this doc. (it rambles, so maybe not all bad)
    // but if I do not gitignore, it is a pubically visible eyesore to any random person on the internet. Embarrasing, and not useful to anyone else.
    // OTOH, nobody is going to ever see/read my repos anyway!
    //   and once in a while I loose track of a solution that I found long ago, and now do not remember.
    //   also, I do project in spurts, and forget what I was working on, or issues I had when I eventurally revisit!
    //   and I have some stupid compulsion to record processes, ugh. It is annoying to me. TIME CONSUMING. But compulsory! cannot be helped.
    //   Also, though, how many times has documenting some little thing come to my rescue YEARS LATER?
    //   I *guess* for now, I...UGH. I ..uh..I don't like either option.
    //   Is there a commit, but visible ONLY TO ME option??? ugh.
    // Need to keep this WITH the repo.
    // Consider THIS solution: https://stackoverflow.com/a/62213595/5411817
    //  (private plus public repo, linked locally)
    //  until then: just don't commit this file? (or temp add it to gitignore?)

    SOLUTIONS (to 2021-11-30 issues):
    1) FORK epicreact-module. Then CLONE my fork. (change clone url in his instructions)
    3) VScode: Install Recommended Extensions when FIRST OPEN module repo/workspace
    4) VSCode: rename .vscode/settings.kcd.json to .vscode/settings.json
    Started the course.
    5) DEV BROWSER: add .env file (better yet: .env.local so it is gitignored, re: must use a different name for each OS, and do not want other users to be stuck with your browser choice) with:
        BROWSER='chrome'
    6) private Notes: *could simply make this repo private!)
        currently, moved it into folder `z-SH_NOTES_private` to be out of the way (end of folders list)
        it is pubically visible :-(. Nobody sees my repos anyway.
        Just make sure no "SECRET" info gets posted.

2021-11-30 and

    Issues: FORK 1st. VSCode Settings. VSCode Extensions. DEV Browser.
    1-  FORK:
        had to delete and re-install (re: FORK for git, and VScode extensions).
        - In order to be able to git save my work, must first FORK his repo.
        Then alter his instructions CLONE MY FORK, instead of his repo.
        - only have access to install recommended
        extensions the FIRST time open a particular folder, or workspace!
        (searching for them manually returned ambiguous results, so better to have them auto installed.)
    2-  (VSCode)
        Decided to use Visual Studio code, for the first time. It is a bit confusing to get started.
        Also decided to use his recommended vscode extensions and his same vscode extensions.
        But HOW?? This part took *forever* to figure out. Wish he put this info in his repo. Search results were not very helpful. Hard to get the right search term, and results assumed a level of knowledge/familiarity that skipped over the base-line knowledge needed to apply the knowledge.
    3-  EXTENSIONS: Workspace (Repo) Recommended VSCode EXTENSIONS
    To install his recommended extensions, For This Repo Only:
        When open the Workkspace or repo Folder for the FIRST TIME (only),
        an option is given to install the "repo's/workspace/s recommended extensions"
        Say Yes. Note to distinguish between the repo's recommended extensions from "generic" community/vscode recommended extenssions!!!
        - The list in in the file `<repo-name>/.vscode/extensions.json`. Here `react-fundamentals` is the <repo-name>.
            - Can open the .vscode/extensions.json file, then
            - click the bottom-left squares "Extensions" icon.
            - Then search for the items in the extensions folder, BUT entering the namespace (portion before the first dot), will come up EMPTY every time.
              And just entering the portion after the last dot, often returns MANY results. So choosing the correct one can be ambiguous.
              Finally, there are 2 sections: Workkspace Recommendations and Other Recommendations.
              Can open those sections to see what extensions are active ONCE extensions are installed.
              Or can FILTER recommendations by those.
              BUT it does not seem to work until AFTER extensions are *already* installed.
              Or it is unreliable and requires wizardry that I have not figured out to get it to work.
              Hence, most reliable is if THE FIRST TIME open the repo, and know you want them installed, to do so.
    4-  SETTINGS: (applying/using Dodd's VSCode SETTINGS file)
        The trick to getting VScode to use apply specific WORKSPACE SETTINGS is to include a
        `/.vscode/settings.json` file. This will override USER global settings.
        So RENAME Kent's `.vscode/settings.kcd.json` file to `settings.json`.
        To revert, just rename the file again to anything else (or delete)
    5-  DEV BROWSER: (browser used by npm start)
        To get the dev build to open a specific browser, other than the OS system's DEFAULT BROWSER:
        (RE: it is recommended to use Chrome or Firefox so have access to React Dev Tools Extensions)
        - *can* change line in `package.json` to:
             `"start": "BROWSER=chrome react-scripts start"`
            BUT then it would be added to the repo, and may not be preferred by other users (though nobody else would ever use this repo!!)
            worse: the command used is dependant on OS.
            (eg BROWSER="chrome" (windows), "google-chrome"(Mac), "google chrome"(linux))
            So it is hacky, and can make the repo unusable from a different OS.
        - recommended by React is to:
            - create an `.env` file, which is NOT saved to the repo (.gitignored), but will work locally. Also need to remember to add it to every project manually.
            - Or create a shell env variable, but then it would always be applied to every project or command from the command line.
            https://create-react-app.dev/docs/advanced-configuration/
        - also suggested is to add a DEV dependancy that sets the browser for the repo, but also auto switches syntax to account for the user's OS.
            (https://stackoverflow.com/a/60808843/5411817)
            eg: `npm install --save-dev cross-env`
            then `"start": "cross-env BROWSER=chrome react-scripts start"` in `package.json`
        -
    6-  How to keep these rambling notes private?
        -  Public and Private separate repos, but linked locally.
